I am currently a Postdoctoral fellow under [Nurturing Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Capacity in Africa (BRecA)](https://www.breca.mak.ac.ug/), a programme funded by US' [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/). I also teach on the MSc/PhD programme at the [African Centre of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data Sciences (ACE)](https://ace.idi.co.ug/), [Makerere University](https://www.mak.ac.ug/). I am affiliated to the [Makerere University/UVRI Infection and Immunity Research Training Programme (MUII-plus)](https://www.muii.org.ug/) and the [Centre for Computational Biology, Uganda Christian University](https://github.com/compbiorg/).

My interest generally lies in using computational approaches to answer epidemiology research questions. 

These computational approaches include: Mathematical and statistical modelling; Social and contact network building an analysis; Genomic data analysis including Whole Genome Sequence Analysis and Data science and machine learning (AI).

Main data of interest includes: Social and contact networks; Mobility patterns; Air quality data; Data on meteorological conditions (weather data); Pathogen genomic data (such as Whole Genome Sequence data); Human Genetic data and Other epidemiological data of individuals such as patient demographics and clinical characteristics.

My focus is on using the above computational approaches and data to aid in: Understanding the transmission of infectious diseases (including patters and drivers) and the interplay between infectious and non-communicable diseases; Identifying risk factors for (predictors of) disease and disease outcomes; Evaluating the impact of health related interventions; Formulation and analysis of mathematical and statistical models; Determining health, social and economic impacts of health related social shocks such as pandemics.
