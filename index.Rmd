I am currently the Deputy Director and a Bioinformatics/data scientist at [The African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data Sciences (ACE-Uganda)](https://ace.idi.co.ug/), [The Infectious Diseases Institute](https://idi.mak.ac.ug/), [Makerere University](https://www.mak.ac.ug/), Kampala, Uganda. I also teach on the MSc/PhD Bioinformatics programme at [Makerere University](https://www.mak.ac.ug/) hosted at ACE-Uganda.

My research interests lie in using quantitative methodologies (e.g., data science, mathematical modeling, bioinformatics and advanced statistical methodologies etc.) to answer epidemiology research questions as well as address bio-medical and public health problems, with a focus on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). This involves using innovative in-silico approaches for designing antimicrobial drug combination therapies, employing bioinformatics techniques to identify One-Health AMR transmission pathways, utilizing data science methodologies to guide antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and using machine learning techniques to predict clinical outcomes of patients with drug resistant infections. I also have a strong passion for training and mentorship having benefited from both. I believe in building a critical mass of quantitative scientists so as to redress the capacity gap and to perform and complete projects with immediate relevance to national and regional health issues.
