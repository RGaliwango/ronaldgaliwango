I am currently a Postdoctoral fellow under [Nurturing Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Capacity in Africa (BRecA)](https://www.breca.mak.ac.ug/), a programme funded by US' [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/). I also teach on the MSc/PhD programme at the [African Centre of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data Sciences (ACE)](https://ace.idi.co.ug/), [Makerere University](https://www.mak.ac.ug/). I am affiliated to the [Makerere University/UVRI Infection and Immunity Research Training Programme (MUII-plus)](https://www.muii.org.ug/) and the [Centre for Computational Biology, Uganda Christian University](https://github.com/compbiorg/).

My interest generally lies in using computational approaches to answer epidemiology research questions. 

These computational approaches include:
* Mathematical and statistical modelling
* Social and contact network building an analysis
* Genomic data analysis including Whole Genome Sequence Analysis
* Data science and machine learning (AI)

The main data of interest includes:
* Social and contact networks 
* Mobility patterns 
* Air quality data
* Data on meteorological conditions (weather data)
* Pathogen genomic data (such as Whole Genome Sequence data)
* Human Genetic data
* Other epidemiological data of individuals 

My focus is on using the above computational approaches and data to aid in: 
* Understanding the transmission of infectious diseases (including patters and drivers) and the interplay between infectious and non-communicable diseases.
* Identifying risk factors for (predictors of) disease and disease outcomes.
* Evaluating the impact of health related interventions
*Formulation and analysis of mathematical and statistical models
* Determining health, social and economic impacts of health related social shocks such as pandemics
