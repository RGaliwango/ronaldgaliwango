I am the Deputy Director for [The African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data Sciences (ACE-Uganda)](https://ace.idi.co.ug/) located at the [The Infectious Diseases Institute](https://idi.mak.ac.ug/), [Makerere University](https://www.mak.ac.ug/), Kampala, Uganda, where I am a Bioinformatics Scientist and the Data Science Lead. I also teach on the MSc/PhD Bioinformatics programme at [Makerere University](https://www.mak.ac.ug/) hosted at ACE-Uganda.

My research encompasses using quantitative methodologies (machine learning, mathematical modeling and simulation, bioinformatics and advanced statistical methodologies) to answer epidemiology research questions as well as address bio-medical and public health problems, with a focus on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and Epidemic Modelling. I also have a strong passion for training and mentorship, contributing to various training programmes in the country.
