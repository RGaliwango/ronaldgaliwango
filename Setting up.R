My interest generally lies in using computational approaches to answer epidemiology research questions. 

These computational approaches include:
  *Mathematical and statistical modelling
*Social and contact network building an analysis
*Genomic data analysis including Whole Genome Sequence Analysis
*Data science and machine learning (AI)

The main data of interest includes:
  *Social and contact networks 
*Mobility patterns 
*Air quality data
*Data on meteorological conditions (weather data)
*Pathogen genomic data (such as Whole Genome Sequence data)
*Human Genetic data
*Other epidemiological data of individuals 

My focus is on using the above computational approaches and data to aid in: 
  *Understanding the transmission of infectious diseases (including patters and drivers) and the interplay between infectious and non-communicable diseases.
*Identifying risk factors for (predictors of) disease and disease outcomes.
*Evaluating the impact of health related interventions
*Formulation and analysis of mathematical and statistical models
*Determining health, social and economic impacts of health related social shocks such as pandemics
