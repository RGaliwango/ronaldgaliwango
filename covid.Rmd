With other colleagues at the [Centre for Computational Biology, Uganda Christian University](https://github.com/compbiorg/), we modelled SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Uganda and published two key policy briefs ([brief 1](https://www.pmldaily.com/investigations/special-reports/2020/05/v.html) and [brief 2](https://www.pmldaily.com/investigations/special-reports/2020/05/policybrief-experts-warn-that-exclusive-use-of-face-masks-may-not-be-useful-as-lifting-of-covid-19-lockdown-beckons.html)) and a [manuscript](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3633199). This work informed that truck drivers posed a threat to spark a community epidemic in the country, which has actually been the case. Our models also showed that social distancing combined with use of face-masks would contain the epidemic but exclusive use of face-masks would not.

Following the second wave of COVID-19 in Uganda we conducted modelling predictions for the third wave of COVID-19 in Uganda. This was was published in a [policy brief](https://www.newvision.co.ug/articledetails/110014) in local print and online media. Based on our modelling approaches, we predicted that the country was likely to experience a third wave early 2022 that would warrant another lockdown, if adequate vaccination was not achieved for more than half of the nationâ€™s population. In addition, our models showed that vaccination and testing efforts needed to be supplemented by a continued sensitization of adherence to the SOPs even after receipt of the vaccine.

Again, under COVID-19, I am part of the  [COAST (End-to-end AI and data systems for targeted surveillance and management of COVID-19 and future pandemics affecting Uganda (COAST)](https://coastv1-a7dd67bb-d488-44c3-ba50.cranecloud.io/) modelling workstream where we are using large datasets from radio transcripts on COVID-19 community voices, human mobility data, air qaulity data and data on meteorological conditions (weather) and other data to inform data-driven modelling (statistical, machine learning and mathematical forecasting models) of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics in Uganda.
